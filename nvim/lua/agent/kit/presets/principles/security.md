<!-- core: true -->

### Security

- **Validate at every boundary**: input from users, APIs, files and queues is parsed into typed values with allowlists, size and range limits; reject, never sanitize-and-hope.
- **Injection**: parameterized queries and safe APIs only; never build SQL, shell commands, paths or HTML by string concatenation with input.
- **Authorization on every request**: check that this user may do this action on this resource (object-level), server-side, deny by default.
- **Authentication**: proven libraries, hashed passwords (argon2id/bcrypt), short-lived tokens, secure cookies (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`), CSRF protection for cookie sessions.
- **Secrets** never in code, logs, URLs or the repository; they come from the environment or a secret manager and are rotatable.
- **Least privilege**: database users, service accounts, tokens and containers get only the permissions they need.
- **Output encoding** by context (HTML, attribute, URL, JS); security headers (CSP, HSTS) on web apps.
- **No PII or secrets in logs**; personal data is minimized, encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest where required.
- **Dependencies** are pinned and scanned (Dependabot, `npm audit`, `govulncheck`, `cargo audit`); known-vulnerable versions block the build.
- Review check: every new endpoint has an authorization check and input validation; no new string-built query or command.
